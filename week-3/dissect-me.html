<!-- 
What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
	We tend to use header and footer often. These two are commonly used and 
	generally have designated content. In the Header you will often find the 
	description of the web page and in the footer you will find information such 
	as the copyright and date. I suppose we use them so often because of their 
	commonly known functions.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
	Unless you've positioned your elements to be perceived in a different order
	they should appear as you wrote them in the HTML. 
	
	<body>
	<header>stuff</header>
	<footer>stuff</footer>
	</body>

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
	I learned you can make snippets to insert your own lines of code with key 
	words that you choose. I guess I will, maybe, if I'm using large snippets of 
	identical code in multiple documents.
