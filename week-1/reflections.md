#1.1 Think About Time
###Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?
I focused a lot of my attention on meditation aspects of time management. I'm very much a believer that you have to get in the correct emotional state to be productive towards your goals. I really like the idea that there is scientific evidence that backs the activity of meditation. For me personally, I can create a schedule and decide I'm going to do this, this, and this but it doesn't really help as much as I would like it to.

###What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?
Time Boxing is just creating blocks of time where you decide to focus on one activity or project. Of course it will be helpful to create a schedule in Phase 0 to stay organized.

###How do you manage your time currently?
Essentially, I just sit down and work on a project until it is finished, taking random breaks here and there.

###Is your current strategy working? If not, why not
Eventually the goal is completed but I'm looking to become more organized. I'm going to try meditation to increase my focus and also create step by step schedule and see how it works out first. 

###Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?
Meditation in the morning, afternoon, and evening. I'm going to break down each week of work the weekend before and make a schedule.

###What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?
Finding a system that works for me and sticking to it before the hard stuff comes.

#1.2 The Command Line
*What is a shell? What is "bash?": Bash is a version of a shell that is used by GNU operating systems. A shell would be an interpreter for communicating with the machine, giving the user the ability to execute commands that the computer is capable of.

*What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?: I suppose that would be, figuring out how pushd and popd were working.

*Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?: Yes.

*In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?: I would say touch, and mkdir and their counterparts. Also, ls which seems to be able to do quite a few things.

*Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

-pwd: print working directory

-ls: list

-mv: move a file or directory

-cd: change directory

-../: move back a directory and then potentially forward

-touch: create a file

-mkdir: make a directory

-less: show the contents of a file page by page
