###Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
Go to your GitHub page and look for the plus symbol on the upper right hand corner and click it. Once the menu drops down click "New repository". Give your repository a name, choose public or private, add a READEME if you want, add a license if you want, and click "Create repository". In your terminal on your computer navigate to the folder you want to clone the repository to. Once there, go back to your newly created repository on GitHub. Look at the bottom right side of the page for a title, **HTTP** clone URL and copy the URL below. Now, go back to your terminal, make sure you are in the folder you wish to clone the repository to, run this command: **git clone *paste URL link here* ** and hit enter.

###Describe what open source means.
Open source means the original source code is available to see and manipulate. It provides a way for lots of different people to collaborate on projects. They may be friends, coworkers, strangers, or anyone.

###What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
Open Source is a difficult concept for me personally. There is a large philisophical debate between Open Source and Free Software, which can be difficult to understand. Either way, I like it for the most part.

###Assess the importance of using licenses.
Is it? If you want something protected as property, sure, use a license. The purpose of an MIT license is to make sure that the license continues with the source code wherever it goes but that in itself is a restriction of a freedom. A license is important for the means it was created. That is it. 

###What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
Just continually doing git practice is great. Remembering the steps to the correct pull request formula can be difficult. 

###Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
nope
