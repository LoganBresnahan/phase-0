***What is a wireframe?***
	A wireframe is a bare-bones visual skeleton of what you want your website to look like and how you want it laid out.

***What are the benefits of wireframing?***
	It gives you a goal to work towards. It might help you visualize how you need to code the site based on the frame.

***Did you enjoy wireframing your site?***
	I did very much. In my free time I imagine I will play with it some more.

***Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?***
	For now I'm sticking with the original idea, but I imagine that will change as I start coding it.

***What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?***
	I suppose I was just interested in learning more about it rather than asking specific questions. Wireframing seems very free-form. It's not entirely necessary. To further my knowledge I watched some YouTube videos on different wireframing programs.

***Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?***
	I really enjoyed spacing out my content. I spent the majority of the time calculating exact distances. I don't find this tedious yet.
