***What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?***
	1. Info Gathering: This includes lots of stuff. What do you want? What does the client want? How much time? What is the overall goal. Info gathering is the rock beneath your feat. Gather as much as you can so you're not missing vital info down the road.

	2. Planning: Take all of your info and make a comprehensive plan. Plan before you do so you don't get lost.

	3. Design: How do you want it to look? What are you trying to convey. You can also test your design with your client. Do they like what you have so far?

	4. Development: Time to take all of that design and make it functional with code. You can build the whole site at this stage. Implementing your features and deciding what fits and what doesn't. 

	5. Testing and Delivery: You must test the website to make sure it's not super buggy or just plain awful. If you have a client you can help them set it up on a server or whatever!

	6. Maintenance: Will you continue to update and maintain it? What kind of platform is it hosted on? Can a client access and change things?

***What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?***
	Right now I'll just say the purpose of my site is to be a blog and a repository of my personal projects. I want it to feature a list of articles that I write about web development and why I think it's great. The goal is for people to read it! Probably people that know less than I do so it seems impressive.

	The projects will most likely be linked to my GitHub account. After reading my blog the readers should feel comfortable looking at them and digesting the information.

***What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?***
	People that are curious about web dev, but also future employers. If I find the GitHub links are not good for the *feng shui* of the site I will try to implement them on the blog.

***What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's OK to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.***
	The action of looking at my projects. The way I see it, either they are interested in me and go to the projects repository right away or they need to be coaxed by my witty writing and read my blog first. The main goal is the exposure of my projects.

***What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?***
	Tough one. Probably, just that, it's really important. If you are putting something out there for someone else to look at, consume, etc... They need it to be easy to experience. Meaning, it must be easy to use, navigate, and enjoy. Design fluctuates, so, it's hard to say a certain design style is best. Just pay attention to the numbers and utilize UX analytics.

***What is user experience design and why is it valuable?*** 
	Designing your product so it's satisfies the user. Kinda like I stated in my answer before. It's important because the more people use it the more they like it. Plus, you might get satisfaction out of satisfying them.

***Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?***
	Answering these questions. Also, finding a free and "good" program or website to make an acceptable template.
