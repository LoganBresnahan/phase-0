<!--  Reflection  
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site? 

    It was really fun! It's always nice to put your work into fruition. Plus, actually typing out and doing the work it beneficial for my memory!


- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

    Once again, fun. HTML, seems simple enough, that it's not too hard to interpret different form tags. I also learned of some new tags thanks to my partner!


- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

    I would say pretty well. When running our code through the HTML Validation Tool we didn't have that many mistakes. We did have a few warnings about considering to use <h> tags but we decided it's not what we wanted stylistically. 


- What seems good and bad about HTML?

    Strangely, I would say HTML's limitations are good and bad. Being limited in what it can do can become frustrating stylistically, but at the same time it allows HTML to do what it does best. HTML really should just be a skeleton for your page. I will say that I hate HTML comments. They are too much, just make it like Ruby with a #.


- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

    Not much. Just always use <> and the closing </>. My partner did show me a neat trick for comments, you can highlight what you want commented and hit Ctrl or Command with the / (forward slash) and it will comment all that was highlighted!
