/*
1. As a user, I want to have two lists of numbers. One with an odd amount of numbers in it and one 
   with an even amount of numbers in it.

2. As a user, I want to make an action that takes three different guidelines. 
   Some kind of test, a message I can send, and a number to list the number of tests I do.
   As a user, I want my action to see if my test is legal or illegal. If my test is illegal I want to 
   show on the screen the list number I am testing with the word "false" next to it, and I want
   to show the word "ERROR: " with the message guideline on the screen. If my test is legal I
   want to show the list number I am testing on the screen in front of the word "true" and I want
   my program to asses as being legal. 
 
3. As a user, I want my first action to test if the total sum is a viable action, or in other words, will the total
   sum work with my action. I want my message to say something like, "total sum should be a working action",
   I want this to be my first action listed numerically when it shows on the screen.

4. As a user, I want to test if the total sum of the odd amount of numbers list is equal to 27, I want
   the message to say something like, "the total sum should show the sum of all the numbers from the odd 
   numbers list." This should be the second action listed numerically.

5. As a user, I want to test if the total sum of the even amount of numbers list is equal to 43, I want
   the message to say something like, "the total sum should show the sum of all the numbers from the even 
   numbers list." This should be the third action listed numerically. 

6. As a user, I want to test if the mean is a viable action, or in other words, will the mean
   work with my action. I want the message to say something like, "mean should be a viable action."
   This should be the forth action listed numerically.

7. As a user, I want to test if the mean of the odd amount of numbers list is equal to 3.857142857142857
   The message should say something like, "the mean should show the average of all the numbers from the odd
   numbers list." This should be the fifth action listed numerically.

8. As a user, I want to test if the mean of the even amount of numbers list is equal to 5.375
    The message should say something like, "the mean should show the average of all the numbers from the even
    numbers list." This should be the sixth action listed numerically.

9. As a user, I want to test if the median is a viable action, or in other words, will the median
    work with my action. I want the message to say something like, "the median should be a be a viable action."
    This should be the seventh action listed numerically.

10. As a user, I want to test if the median of the odd amount of numbers list is equal to 4.
    The message should say something like, "the median should show the median of all the numbers from the odd 
    numbers list." This should be the eighth action listed numerically.

11. As a user, I want to test if the median of the even amount of numbers list is equal to 5.5.
	The message should say something like, "the median should show the median of all the numbers from the even
	numbers list." This should be the ninth action listed numerically.
