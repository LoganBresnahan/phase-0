// Text Questions
// Introduction
// -Did you learn anything new about JavaScript or programming in general?
// 	Yes, I don't really know much about it at all. He says that it is very
// 	liberal which scares me. I love throwing code at the interpreter to see if 
// 	it works, but I imagine I will need to be more careful with JavaScript.

// -Are there any concepts you feel uncomfortable with?
// 	As of now no, I'm sure I will when I start to really use it. I'm looking forward
// 	to using JS as I imagine it will force me to be a little more logical and careful with
// 	my code vs using Ruby.

// -Identify two similarities and two differences between JavaScript and Ruby syntax with regard to 
// numbers, arithmetic, strings, booleans, and various operators.
//	For numbers is seems that both languages can use operators to perform arthmitic. Both languages
// 	can manipulate either whole numbers or decimals. Ruby though, has two different classes for numbers,
// 	and Integer class and Float class. JS just has a Number class for both.

//	Whith strings, Both languages allow you to wrap them in "" or ''. Both use the \ to esacape
//	characters. In Ruby you can perform string interpolation but with JS you only have the +.

//	It looks like JS has some operators that are of written word rather than symbol, such as, typeof.
//	I don't believe Ruby has this.

//	Both use the booleans true and false but JS does have NaN (not a number) while Ruby would probably
//	return an error instead.
//	Both have the ternanry operator and use the || && ! logical operators.

//	With undefined values Ruby will return nil but JS will return null or undefined.
//	JS also has type coercion which will change certain values types. Ruby does not do this automatically.
//	In Ruby the only false objects are nil and false but in JS 0, NaN, and ("") count as false in type coercion.
//	With JS and using the == you can fall into type coercion traps so the alternative is to use ===. In Ruby,
//	you only want to use the === if you need to find out if the two objects evaluate to the same object_id.
